### Here for milestone 3 I focused on learning animations, transitions, and inserting CSS styles into HTML/other ways of using CSS

### The milestone project goes off of updates to the root html pages in one folder
### Events.html has new CSS code put in it
### As well as a mysite.css or a .css file to reference in the folder

### If you'd like a particular way for the milestone project to be formatted let me know!
