## In activity three it covered the < style> < / style > function and inserting CSS into html

### In return it also goes over the link tag, or another way to insert code

### < link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/yourfile.css" >

## W3 also goes over inserting code and breaks down 3 ways


## Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
## Internal - by using a < style > element in the < head > section
## External - by using a < link > element to link to an external CSS file

### The above mentioned would be an external method, as it's grabbing a CSS format from a file - in this case yourfile.css
